${key population module}
==========================

Description
-----------
This module integrates the Key population system (KPS) into KenyaEMR.
It is a combination of Outreach, Program and Clinical tools.
The main focus of the module is in provision of services and commodities both 
at the hotspot/outreach level and at the clinical level.




Installation
------------
1. Build the module to produce the .omod file.
2. Use the OpenMRS Administration > Manage Modules screen to upload and install the .omod file.

If uploads are not allowed from the web (changable via a runtime property), you can drop the .omod
into the ~/.OpenMRS/modules folder.  (Where ~/.OpenMRS is assumed to be the Application 
Data Directory that the running kenyaEMR is currently using.)  After putting the file in there 
simply restart OpenMRS/tomcat and the module will be loaded and started.
